SBLIM WBEMSMT Metacluster README
----------------------------------

Introduction
------------

The wbemsmt-vm package provides the virtual machine jsf application and commandline interface. 

Source Package Contents
-----------------------

./README		    This file
./build.xml         Apache Ant build file
./java/*            Contains the java(tm) source files



General Requirements
--------------------
In order to build, install and operate this package you will need a 
Java SDK or Run Time Environment of version 1.5 or higher, depending on
whether you build binaries from sources or use the pre-built binaries (JAR
file).

Sun Java SDK/JRE:
For users of the Sun Java packages, the following package is required to be 
adapted into the CLASSPATH environment variable:
 - xerces    http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j

IBM Java SDK/JRE:
Because the IBM Java packages include already the xerces package, no further
requirements need to be resolved.


Building and Installing this package
------------------------------------
As a requirement for building this package, Apache Ant 
(http://ant.apache.org) needs to be setup properly. We would like to recommend
a Apache Ant version 1.6.5 or higher. (Lower versions might also work properly
here)

The build process is based on Apache Ant, so it is very easy to build the 
this component. 

An Ant build.xml file is in place which supports specific targets. 
Call ant with the option -projecthelp to get the information which targets are supported.
  
The execution of the build process is very easy. Once, Apache Ant is setup 
properly on your system, just execute 'ant <target>' in the 'basedir' directory.
The output will be written into a new created directory named 'target'. That's all.
