  * Description: CIM_System represents an entity made up of component parts (defined by the SystemComponent relationship), that operates as a 'functional whole'. Systems are top-level objects in the CIM hierarchy, requiring no scoping or weak relationships in order to exist and have context. It should be reasonable to uniquely name and manage a System at an enterprise level. For example, a ComputerSystem is a kind of System that can be uniquely named and independently managed in an enterprise. However, these qualities are not true for the power supply (or the power supply sub-'system') within the computer. 
  * 
  * Although a System can be viewed as a Collection, this view is not the correct model. A Collection is simply a 'bag' that 'holds' its members. A System is a higher-level abstraction, built out of its individual components. It is more than the sum of its parts. Note that System is a subclass of EnabledLogicalElement which allows the entire abstraction to be functionally enabled or disabled at a higher level than enabling or disabling its component parts.

This class is very broadly defined, which can lead to erroneous use. For example, Access Points that are dependent on (and hosted on) a System are NOT Components of the System. The System is not made up of any AccessPoint 'parts', which is why a Dependency association, HostedAccessPoint, was defined. Similarly, a PhysicalPackage is not a 'part' of a System, because the physical element exists independently of any internal components, software, and so on. In fact, again, a Dependency relationship is true where a ComputerSystem is Dependent on its packaging, as described by the ComputerSystemPackage association.
