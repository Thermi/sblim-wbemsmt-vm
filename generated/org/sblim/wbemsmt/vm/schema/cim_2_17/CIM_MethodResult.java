 * Description: Jobs are sometimes used to represent extrinsic method invocations that execute for times longer than the length of time is reasonable to require a client to wait. The method executing continues beyond the method return to the client. The class provides the result of the execution of a Job that was itself started by the side-effect of this extrinsic method invocation. 
 * The indication instances embedded an instance of this class MUST be the same indications delivered to listening clients or recorded, all or in part, to logs. Basically, this approach is a corollary to the functionality provided by an instance of ListenerDestinationLog (as defined in the Interop Model). The latter provides a comprehensive, persistent mechanism for recording Job results, but is also more resource-intensive and requires supporting logging functionality. Both the extra resources and logging MAY NOT be available in all environments (for example, embedded environments). Therefore, this instance-based approach is also provided. 
 * The MethodResult instances MUST NOT exist after the associated ConcreteJob is deleted.
