 *            the instance value of a metric. Since the gathering of metric information can involve
 *            large quantities of information there may be many instances of this class. The use of
 *            this class as an instrumentation source may be inefficient unless the rate of metrics
 *            are known. The length of time a CIM_BaseMetricValue instance exists after the metric
 *            information is captured is not defined and is implementation dependent. Most metric
 *            data values change over time. There are two ways of mapping this into
 *            CIM_BaseMetricValue objects: The value for the next point in time may use the same
 *            object and just change its properties (such as the value or timestamp), or the
 *            existing objects remain unchanged and a new object is created for the new point in
 *            time. The first method is typically used for snapshot data and the second method for
 *            historical data. Which method is used, is indicated by the Volatile property.
