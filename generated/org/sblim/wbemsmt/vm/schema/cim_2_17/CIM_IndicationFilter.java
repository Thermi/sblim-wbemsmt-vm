Query language semantics include projection (e.g., Select), range (e.g., From) and predicate (e.g., Where).

If only one subclass of CIM_Indication is named, it defines the CIM_Indication that this Instance of CIM_IndicationFilter will produce. If more than one subclass of CIM_Indication is named, then one of them must be named explicitly in the select-list. 
     * The select-list must refer explicitly or implicitly to exactly one CIM_Indication subclass. In addition, it shall conform to one of several options: 
     * 1) only a "*": This may only be used if the Indication subclass is the only entry on the FROM list. 
     * 2) only a "<Indicationclass or alias>.*": This form may be used if the FROM clause contains more than one Indication subclass. 
     * 3) a list of the form "<propertyname>*[","[<literal> AS ]<propertyname>]": This form may only be used if the CIM_Indication subclass is the only entry on the FROM list. In this form, the literal is assigned to the named property of the selected CIM_Indication subclass 
     * 4) a list of the form "<Indicationname>.<propertyname> *["," [<Indicationname>.<propertyname> |"": <literal> AS <propertyname> | <fromname>.<propertyname> AS <propertyname> ] ]" : The first term selects the appropriate CIM_Indication subclass to produce. Subsequent terms allow other properties of that indication, or allow a literal or property of another class to be assigned to the output as one of the properties of the selected CIM_Indication subclass. 
     * Note that in all cases, only the property names of the selected CIM_Indication subclass may be referred to in the select-list.
     * When used with "DMTF:CQLT", the additional string array property TemplateVariable should be used to provide additional filtering information to the query.
